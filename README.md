# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML and CSS. The main goal of this project was to create a responsive website that is themed around an exciting blog post related to ballon's.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

To access VScode Live Server you can open the index.html file and then navigate to the top right where there will be a rectangle with a magnifying glass. Additionally the user can open the live preview and then copy and paste the link it gives into a browser.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

Note: there are no tests to run for this project cause the main goal was to create a webpage to respond to the viewports size.
